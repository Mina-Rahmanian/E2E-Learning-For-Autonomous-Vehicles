# End-to-End Deep Learning for AV's Control


The goal of this project is to train an End-to-End deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) that would let a car drive agent on the tracks of Udacityâ€™s car simulator environment. Then, we train different deep network after applying the required data pre-processings, then, the performance of each model are compared. Results show that our developed model with filter leads to better autonomous driving in the Udacity simulator.
